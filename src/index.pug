					p
						| Born and raised as a third-generation East Vancouver resident, Mark Wiens is a proud father, and lifelong community advocate.
						| Rooted in Vancouver East, he’s spent his life supporting local families, newcomers, and small businesses—building stronger, more connected neighbourhoods across the riding.
					p
						| Mark understands the challenges facing our community: the rising cost of living, deepening inequality, and a housing system that’s leaving too many behind.
						| He’s spent years helping families navigate Vancouver’s broken housing market, and now serves as a Director at Greater Vancouver Realtors—pushing for transparency, accountability, and housing that puts people before profit.
						| Before that, Mark ran a small landscaping business that created local jobs and supported working families.
						| He knows what it means to build something from the ground up—and why government must support small businesses and everyday workers.

						| One hundred years ago my ancestors came to Canada with nothing, and our country has given me and my family everything we have.
						| It’s time to give back, especially in this current time of crisis around the world, across the country and right here at home in Vancouver East where we are facing unprecedented challenges.
						| The prohibitive cost of housing, the general rising cost of living, the deterioration of public safety, economic instability and even annexation threats from the United States are all threats we are now facing in a way we have never felt before.
						| Adding to this, the values of equality, diversity, inclusion, reconciliation and even Canadian sovereignty are under threat.
						| Canadians have always proven that when we stand united and work together, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.
						| I’m running to protect the values that make our country strong – values which are now at risk.
					p
						| As a real estate professional, I’ve seen first-hand how the high cost and low availability of suitable housing has caused many families to make difficult decisions and huge sacrifices.
						| My work as a Director at Greater Vancouver Realtors has allowed me to witness the challenges and opportunities for real estate at an institutional and government level.
						| My experience volunteering with multicultural societies, and with the arts, has imprinted on me the importance of inclusion and being able to express oneself, and the untapped potential of our diverse society.
						| As a former small business owner, I know how hard it can be to make ends meet and I understand that the government has a role in assisting businesses to expand which in turn will lead to more hiring and better jobs.

						| As a husband to a first generation immigrant, I know not only the challenges immigrants face, but also the incredible benefits they will bring to our society when we support them.
						| As a sibling to a brother who has suffered life altering mental illness for decades, I have insight into real solutions to the complex problems of mental health and the homeless crisis.
					p
						| Together we have so much potential.
						| My promise to you is to work tirelessly every day across party lines to make real improvement in our society.
						| For too long Vancouver East has not had a meaningful seat at the table in Ottawa.
						| I’m here to listen to you, and transform your concerns and needs into meaningful change that you and your family can feel on a daily basis.
